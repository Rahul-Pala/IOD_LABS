Requirement Gathering Document for Real-Time Database with External API Integration.

Project Overview
-The goal of this project is to develop a real-time database application that fetches data from an external API
(https://api.sampleapis.com/cartoons/cartoons2D), stores it in a database (Mongodb database), and provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The application will follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern and demonstrate the CRUD operations via Postman/Thunderclient.

Requirements
1. Functional Requirements
1.1. Data Fetching and Initialization
Startup Routine: The application must have a startup routine that:
-Connects to the external API.
-Fetches initial data.
-Populates the database with the fetched data.

1.2. CRUD Operations
Create Operation: Ability to add new records to the database.
Read Operation: Ability to fetch and display records from the database.
Update Operation: Ability to modify existing records in the database.
Delete Operation: Ability to remove records from the database.

2. Non-Functional Requirements
2.1. Performance
The system should handle large datasets efficiently.
Real-time updates should be processed with minimal latency.
2.2. Scalability
The system should be scalable to handle increased load, both in terms of API data and user requests.
2.3. Security
Secure connections to the external API and database.
Proper validation and sanitization of all inputs to prevent SQL injection and other security threats.

3. Technical Requirements
3.1. Architecture
MVC Pattern: The application should be structured according to the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture:
Model: Defines the structure of the data and handles the database interactions.
View: Provides the presentation layer to display data to the user.
Controller: Manages user input, interacts with the Model to update the database, and updates the View.

3.2. Technologies
Backend: Node.js/Express for server-side logic.
Database: MongoDB for storing data.
External API: Specification of the external API to fetch data from (https://api.sampleapis.com/cartoons/cartoons2D).
Postman/Thunderclient: Tool to test API endpoints and demonstrate CRUD operations.

3.3. Development Environment
Testing: Postman for API testing.

Detailed Implementation Plan
1. Data Fetching and Initialization

1.1. External API Connection
Define the external API endpoint and authentication method.
Create a service to handle API requests and responses.

1.2. Initial Data Fetch
Implement a function to fetch data from the API.
Ensure the fetched data is transformed to match the database schema.
Insert the transformed data into the database during application startup.

2. MVC Architecture Implementation
2.1. Model
Define the schema for the database (Mongoose for Mongodb).

2.2. View
Create templates or frontend components to display data.

2.3. Controller
Implement controllers to handle CRUD operations:
Create: Endpoint to add a new record.
Read: Endpoint to fetch records (single and multiple).
Update: Endpoint to modify an existing record.
Delete: Endpoint to remove a record.

3. CRUD Operations Demonstration via Postman
3.1. Setup Postman
Define a collection in Postman with requests for all CRUD operations.
3.2. Create Operation
POST request to /create endpoint with JSON body containing new record data.
3.3. Read Operation
GET request to /api/cartoons/:id endpoint to fetch a specific record.
GET request to /api/cartoons/ endpoint to fetch all records.
3.4. Update Operation
PUT request to /update/:id endpoint with JSON body containing updated record data.
3.5. Delete Operation
DELETE request to /delete/:id endpoint to remove a specific record.

Conclusion
This document outlines the requirements and implementation plan for a real-time database application that fetches data from an external API and provides full CRUD operations via an MVC architecture. The application will demonstrate its functionality using Postman for API testing.
